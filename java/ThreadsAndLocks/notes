Thread in java is created and controlled by java.lang.Thread class. When a standalone application is run, a thread is
automatically created to execute the main() method. This thread is called the main thread.

We can implement threads in one of the two ways:
1. By implementing the class java.lang.Runnable interface
2. By extending the class java.lang,Thread class

Difference between Runnable and Thread:
1. java doesn't support multiple inheritance, hence the subclass after extending the thread class will not be able to extend another class
2. a class might only want to be ruunnable instead of inheriting full overhead of the thread class
